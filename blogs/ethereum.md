* the reward is the means and decentralized security is the end.
* PoW consensus is a careful balance of risk and reward that drives participants to behave honestly out of self-interest.
* hot wallet (a wallet whose keys are stored online, in contrast to a cold wallet where the keys are never online)
* remember that the nonce is an integral part of the transaction data and therefore needs to be included in the digital signature that authenticates the transaction
* this would be a choke point in the process: the signing and tracking of nonces is the part of your operation that is likely to become congested under load, whereas the generation of the unsigned transaction is the part you don’t really need to parallelize.
* gigawei = billion wei
* The critical difference is that any interpretation of the data pay‐ load by an EOA is not subject to Ethereum’s consensus rules, unlike a contract execution.
* A failed transaction is still recorded as having been attempted, and the ether spent on gas for the execution is deducted from the originating account, but it otherwise has no other effects on contract or account state.
* This may indeed be the correct way to incorporate tokenization into your project. However, if in order to use your platform a user has to convert something into your utility token, use it, and then convert the remainder back into something more generally useful, you’ve created a company scrip
*  The switching costs of a digital token are orders of magnitude lower than for a physical token without a market, but they are not zero.
* A public offering is the sale of equity shares or other financial instruments to the public in order to raise capital.
* According to some estimates, tokens worth more than roughly $2.5 million USD (at the time of writing) have gotten “stuck” like this and are lost forever.
* many exchanges publish receiving addresses that are actually contracts! These contracts are only meant to receive ether, not ERC20 tokens
* An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a crowdfunding mechanism used by companies and organizations to raise money by selling tokens. The term is derived from Initial Public Offering (IPO), which is the process by which a public company offers shares for sale to invest‐ ors on a stock exchange.
